Overview

GoalBoard Dashboard is a web-based task management application that helps users efficiently manage their daily tasks. Users can add tasks with a specific title, date, and time, mark them as completed, and remove tasks when necessary. The dashboard displays task summaries including total, completed, and pending tasks, along with a daily streak counter. A completion chart provides a visual representation of task progress, and a motivational quote section encourages consistent productivity. The dashboard is fully responsive and occupies the entire window for a clear and user-friendly experience.
